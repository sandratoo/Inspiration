        <p>Inspiration awakens us to new possibilities by allowing us to transcend our ordinary experiences and limitations. Inspiration propels a person from apathy to possibility, and transforms the way we perceive our own capabilities. Inspiration may sometimes be overlooked because of its elusive nature. Its history of being treated as supernatural or divine hasnâ€™t helped the situation. But as recent research shows, inspiration can be activated, captured, and manipulated, and it has a major effect on important life outcomes.</p>
        <p>This app offers a space to  be filled with the urge and ability to do or feel something or to do the same for someone else through motivational or inspirational words.</p>
        <p>Feel free to inspire(leave a motivational message) or get inspired(get a motivational message).</p>
